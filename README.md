Using basic python skills, I’m going to analyse Tones and I’s top two hit songs: ‘Dance Monkey’ and ‘Never Seen The Rain’ to see if there are any similarities and how she creates her own music style ~ in terms of repeating words, use of accoustic words (like ‘oh’ and ‘ah’) etc.

I got the lyrics to both songs from Metro Lyrics and edited them so there were no ‘,’ or extra spaces in between. I also changed words like ‘You’ve’ to ‘You have’ just to maintain the uniformity. You can view the updated lyrics in the lyrics file.
