All your life no You could not be mad about it You have been setting setting oh 
You could not be sad about it And it is been all this time And you have not lived
without it You are shining shining it seems though That your life you have found 
it No oh oh oh But you have never No you have never seen the rain No oh oh oh but 
you have never no you have never Seen the rain And it gets you down But that is ok 
You have been pushed around You feel the pain And when you fall Just lean on me 
Cause you have never known Never seen never smelt never felt The rain Rain never 
felt the rain rain rain It is a cold dark night and No ones trying find ya You are 
just coasting coasting by Cause nothing seems to mind ya No oh oh oh But you have 
never No you have never seen the rain No oh oh oh but you have never no you have 
never Seen the rain And it gets you down But that is ok You have been pushed around 
You feel the pain And when you fall Just lean on me Cause you have never known Never 
seen never smelt never felt The rain Rain never felt the rain rain rain And it gets 
you down But that is ok You have been pushed around You feel the pain And when you 
fall Just lean on me Cause you have never known Never seen Never smelt Never felt 
The rain Rain never felt the rain rain rain
